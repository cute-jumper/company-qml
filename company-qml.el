;; A company-mode backend for QML files.


;; 1 Config
;; ========

;;   1. First, you need plugins.qmltypes files so that they can be parsed
;;      to get the completion information for QML objects. Usually these
;;      files are automatically generated when you install Qt5. In my Arch
;;      Linux, the generated plugins.qmltypes files for QML are:
;;      ,----
;;      | $ locate plugins.qmltypes | grep QtQuick
;;      | /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Controls/plugins.qmltypes
;;      | /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Dialogs/plugins.qmltypes
;;      | /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Extras/plugins.qmltypes
;;      | /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Layouts/plugins.qmltypes
;;      | /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/LocalStorage/plugins.qmltypes
;;      | /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Particles.2/plugins.qmltypes
;;      | /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/PrivateWidgets/plugins.qmltypes
;;      | /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Window.2/plugins.qmltypes
;;      | /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/XmlListModel/plugins.qmltypes
;;      | /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick.2/plugins.qmltypes
;;      `----

;;      If you can't find these files, refer to [this page] for more
;;      information of generating qmltypes files.
;;   2. Set the variable `qmltypes-parser-file-list' to a list of
;;      plugins.qmltypes files. Here is my setting:
;;      ,----
;;      | (setq qmltypes-parser-file-list '("/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Controls/plugins.qmltypes"
;;      |                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Dialogs/plugins.qmltypes"
;;      |                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Extras/plugins.qmltypes"
;;      |                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Layouts/plugins.qmltypes"
;;      |                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/LocalStorage/plugins.qmltypes"
;;      |                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Particles.2/plugins.qmltypes"
;;      |                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/PrivateWidgets/plugins.qmltypes"
;;      |                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Window.2/plugins.qmltypes"
;;      |                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/XmlListModel/plugins.qmltypes"
;;      |                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick.2/plugins.qmltypes"))
;;      `----

;;   3. Finally, add the backend:
;;      ,----
;;      | (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-qml)
;;      `----
;;      Done!

;; 2 *TODO*
;; ========

;;   - Support "as" in import statement.
;;   - Implement a better QML parser. So far we only support very simple
;;     completions.
;;   - Javascript completions.

;;     I'm not proficient in either QML or the development of company-mode
;;     extensions. Any improvements or suggestions are welcome!
