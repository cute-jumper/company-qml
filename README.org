#+TITLE: company-qml
A company-mode backend for QML files.

WORK IN PROGRESS!

* Config
  1. First, you need plugins.qmltypes files so that they can be parsed to get
     the completion information for QML objects. Usually these files are
     automatically generated when you install Qt5. In my Arch Linux, the
     generated plugins.qmltypes files for QML are:
     : $ locate plugins.qmltypes | grep QtQuick
     : /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Controls/plugins.qmltypes
     : /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Dialogs/plugins.qmltypes
     : /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Extras/plugins.qmltypes
     : /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Layouts/plugins.qmltypes
     : /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/LocalStorage/plugins.qmltypes
     : /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Particles.2/plugins.qmltypes
     : /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/PrivateWidgets/plugins.qmltypes
     : /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Window.2/plugins.qmltypes
     : /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/XmlListModel/plugins.qmltypes
     : /usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick.2/plugins.qmltypes

     If you can't find these files, refer to [[http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-qml-modules-with-plugins.html#generating-qmltypes-files][this page]] for more information of
     generating qmltypes files.
  2. Set the variable =qmltypes-parser-file-list= to a list of plugins.qmltypes
     files. Here is my setting:
     : (setq qmltypes-parser-file-list '("/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Controls/plugins.qmltypes"
     :                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Dialogs/plugins.qmltypes"
     :                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Extras/plugins.qmltypes"
     :                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Layouts/plugins.qmltypes"
     :                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/LocalStorage/plugins.qmltypes"
     :                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Particles.2/plugins.qmltypes"
     :                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/PrivateWidgets/plugins.qmltypes"
     :                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/Window.2/plugins.qmltypes"
     :                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick/XmlListModel/plugins.qmltypes"
     :                                   "/usr/lib/qt/qml/QtQuick.2/plugins.qmltypes"))

     If you =require= the =company-qml= in you init files, to make the backend
     work, you must set the =qmltypes-parser-file-list= before that =require=
     expression.
  3. Finally, add the backend:
     : (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-qml)

     Done!
